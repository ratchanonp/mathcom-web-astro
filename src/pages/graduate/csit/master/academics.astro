            <p>
                The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Chulalongkorn University is at the frontier of interdisciplinary research between Mathematics and Computer Science. The department has conducted a wide range of advanced research activities in close cooperation with Thailand Research Fund (TRF) and National Electronics and Computer technology Center (NECTEC). As a consequence, the M.Sc. program in Computer Science and Information Technology offers an excellent opportunity and environment for individuals who wish to pursue in-depth knowledge and advanced research in computer science and information technology. It is designed to collaborate the existing Ph.D. Program in Computer Science and Information Technology.  Various innovations and technical know-how can then be realized through master theses and projects.  In addition, academic and industrial collaborations will also be established to further enhance the potential of those innovative implementations for the benefit of the academic and industrial communities.  Career advancement will consequently be augmented.
