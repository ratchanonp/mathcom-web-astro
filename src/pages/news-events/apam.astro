				Annual Pure and Applied Mathematics Conference (APAM) is organized by the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University (held for the first time in 2008 under the name Annual Mathematics Conference). The objective is being a platform for students, alumni, professors and researchers from various educational institutions across the country to exchange their knowledge, research studies and experiences in pure and applied mathematics, mathematics education and computer science. Moreover, the conference provides a stage for students and researchers to present their research studies nationally with the hope to enhance studentsâ€™ confidence in presenting their work to advance to international stages. From the past years of the conference, there have been many participants and presentations of academic works from universities, educational institutions, as well as government and private organizations.
